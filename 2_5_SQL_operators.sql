-- 2. AND the category is 2 (Clothing)
-- BOTH conditions must be true

-- ðŸ”¹ This query finds all products where:
-- EITHER the price is greater than 100
-- OR the category is 2 (Clothing)
-- If either one is true, the row is included
-- Also sorts the results by product_id

-- ðŸ”¸ Use NOT to exclude results
-- Find products that are NOT in category 2
SELECT *

-- Same as above, using != (not equal)
SELECT *

--ðŸ”¸ Use BETWEEN for range filtering
-- Find products with prices between $50 and $100 (inclusive)
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 100;

--ðŸ”¸ Use IN to match multiple values
-- Find products that belong to category 1, 2, or 3
SELECT *
FROM products

-- Use LIKE for pattern matching
-- Find customers whose names start with 'A'
SELECT *
